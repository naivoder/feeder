		(My own understanding of backLog list to be submitted, per the 
			description of SM and my responsibilities to the PO)
	* In order of ability to be delivered as "Done" (Open to inspection
		and adaptation)
	* Submit with descriptions but, thoughts and questions to be deleted 
	* Assuming there are to be 7 Sprints per our Scrum schedule
	* Please inspect and amend as you see fit
	* Of course this is all adaptable and could change as the project builds
			
	(not sure (1) is an item but, might be best to have clarification
		to help with future Scrum Event iterations)
	1)	Rough sketch of proposed defense system: specifications - 
		Dimensions, functions, capability, standards, constraints
		a)	How will this system be oriented in relation to a feeder?
			Self-standing or attached to feeder
		b)	What are the dimensions of this system?
			Trying to make it as compact as possible
	
	2)	Water Tank: Reserve to store water or option for hard line
		(simplest to deliver but, open to adaptation)
		a)	How persistent are the thieves?
		b)	What is the volumetric flow rate of the pump?
		c)	Include low level sensor?
	
	3)	Turret mounts: Two axis mounting system that can hold squirter alone
		(I've already designed this but, easily adaptable for new ideas
		for the "squirter", I'd also need to modify design to account for
		new stepper motors)
		a)	How large do we need this to be?
			Depends on which squirter is utilized
	
	4)	Manual control "Squirter" with micro controller: On and off to show
		functionality of code to activate pump motor and successful squirts
		a)	Which pump do we want to implement, water gun or DIY build?
			Interested to see how the mini water pumps work and how quiet 
	
	5)	Camera and animal recognition system: camera fixed on target location and 
		video of successful tracking of squirrels
		
	6)	Manual Turret control system with micro controller: Two axis control
		with Arduino and stepper motors on the turret mounts
		
	7)	Fully assembled squirrel deterrent system: All components assembled and
		functioning with minimum criteria met
		(assuming we have achieved all previous sprints successfully)
