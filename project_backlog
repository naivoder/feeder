			~Project Backlog Brainstorming~ 
_______________________________________________________________________________

---> Hardware:
     --------
1) The Squirter: some device that sprays water
	a) How will it be triggered? 
	b) Water reserve?

2) The Turret: mount for The Squirter, actuated for tracking/aim
	a) How will it be controlled?
	b) How many degress of freedom? 
	
 - My assumption was that there would be two orthagonal axis of rotation
 so that the device could be aimed omnidirectionally, i.e. sort of like an
 anti-aircraft gun

3) Microcontroller:
	a) Control actuators (could be done with arduino)
	b) Send video feed to server, receive/execute instructions
	- This MUST be done with R-pi, OpenCV runs on OS so we will need to 
	transmit the video/images over Wifi/ethernet to main computer for
	processing... 

 - This whole project could probably be run on one R-pi, but we could also
 dedicate an arduino to the actuators if there was some reason I can't forsee
 
4) Camera:
	a) Self explanatory, but will need to picked out with budget, hardware and 
	software compatibility in mind. We can get a fairly nice one from MTRE dept.
	I bet, we used a few of them for Dr. Marshall's research project
	
---> Software:
     --------
1) Animal Recognition:
	a) OpenCV - easy peezy. Can identify and track movement.
	
2) Turret Control:
	a) Likely just simple program to keep identified animal in center of 
	screen.
	b) Will need to be carefully calibrated with turret for accuracy
	
- I will be shocked if we can't run this whole project from one python script and <150 lines of code, as we've mentioned if we exceed expectations in time we can add 
further fancy functionality if we want. Perhaps wave when it sees one of us, or squirt Dr. McFall anytime he comes into view. Perhaps provide warning signal?
