			~Project Backlog Brainstorming~ 
_______________________________________________________________________________
			Sorry, didn't want to clutter up your original backLog.
---> Hardware:
     --------
1) The Squirter: some device that sprays water
	a) How will it be triggered? 
		(digitalWrite(relayWaterPump, High), I suggest a mini water
		pump like what is used in a fish tank, with a reduced nozzle hole for amplifying 
		pressure. This and most parts can be printed or are very cheap hardware at local 
		hardware store. Also, there are electric water guns for under 20$)
	b) Water reserve? 
		(The mini water pump can be submerged into reserve, which can be printed
		with the necessary mounts for all components and access ports. Design will 
		depend on location.) Where is this to be placed?(Near the turret but, not on it to save
		the motors of any unnecessary weight.)

2) The Turret: mount for The Squirter, actuated for tracking/aim
	a) How will it be controlled? 
		(I've seen several tutorials on this idea but, the code and the implementation scare me.
		Is there some minimum criteria that can be set in case we can't achieve full tracking and
		aiming of the turrets?)
	b) How many degrees of freedom? 
		(Degrees of freedom entirely depend on the nozzle distance from intrusion zone.)
	c) Where will this be mounted, where in proximity to the feeder? 
		(Deciding where this system might be placed will determine the overall design of
		the structure. Once there is a concept, I can estimate a timescale for this
		backLog item.)
	
 - My assumption was that there would be two orthogonal axis of rotation
 so that the device could be aimed omni-directionally, i.e. sort of like an
 anti-aircraft gun

3) Micro controller:
	a) Control actuators (could be done with arduino)
		Seems straight forward, with relays to the water pump, and the stepper motors.
	b) Send video feed to server, receive/execute instructions
	- This MUST be done with R-pi, OpenCV runs on OS so we will need to 
	transmit the video/images over Wifi/Ethernet to main computer for
	processing... 
		I am now seeing a few tutorials for installing openCV on RPi, this would
		be an incredible leap but, in terms of minimum criteria maybe a laptop
		is still best.

 - This whole project could probably be run on one R-pi, but we could also
 dedicate an arduino to the actuators if there was some reason I can't foresee
 
4) Camera:
	a) Self explanatory, but will need to picked out with budget, hardware and 
	software compatibility in mind. We can get a fairly nice one from MTRE dept.
	I bet, we used a few of them for Dr. Marshall's research project
	
---> Software:
     --------
1) Animal Recognition:
	a) OpenCV - easy peezy. Can identify and track movement.
		If you say so...but, I'd really like to learn how this is done.
	
2) Turret Control:
	a) Likely just simple program to keep identified animal in center of 
	screen.
	b) Will need to be carefully calibrated with turret for accuracy
		*By far, I see this as being the most difficult backLog item
- I will be shocked if we can't run this whole project from one python script and <150 lines of code, as we've mentioned if we exceed expectations in time we can add 
further fancy functionality if we want. Perhaps wave when it sees one of us, or squirt Dr. McFall anytime he comes into view. Perhaps provide warning signal? 
Maybe we can drop treats for neutral animals like dogs?
